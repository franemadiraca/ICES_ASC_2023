Here is a list of the indicators chosen with INDperform to be
modelled under the effect of climate change:

STRUCTURAL
----------
CPUE of Pleuronectiformes
CPUE of Clupeiformes
CPUE in the fish community
Median length in the fish community

FUNCTIONAL
----------
Functional richness in the fish community
Rao's quadratic entropy in the fish community
CWM of offspring size in the fish community
CWM of fecundity in the fish community
CWM of preffered temperature in the fish community

* CPUE = Catch per unit of effort
* CWM = Community weighted mean
