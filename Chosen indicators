Here is a list of the indicators chosen with INDperform to be
modelled under the effects of climate change:

STRUCTURAL
----------
CPUE of Pleuronectiformes
CPUE of Clupeiformes
Mean CPUE in the fish community
Median length in the fish community

FUNCTIONAL
----------
Functional richness
Rao's quadratic entropy
CWM of offspring size
CWM of fecundity
CWM of preffered temperature

* CPUE = Catch per unit of effort
* CWM = Community weighted mean
