Hello,

My name is Frane Madiraca. I am a marine biologist and ecologist
interested in understanding how marine ecosystems and associated
communities are shaped, in space and time, by their environment 
and anthropogenic impacts. If you would like to know more about 
me please check my CV which can be found in this repository.

Speaking of this repository, I created it in order to share a 
bit more information on the research that my colleagues and I
do related to our ICES ASC 2023 presentation. The research I am
presenting deals with comparing structural and functional indicators
related to the status of the fish community in the Baltic Sea and 
modelling the spatio-temporal response of chosen indicators under 
the effects of climate change between 2001 and 2020. Please feel 
free to explore the files provided in this repository as they shed 
more light on everything presented and serve as companions to the 
presentation.

I decided to present our research in a relatively uncommon way. 
Even though I will be present in person at the conference, I 
decided to create a video presentation. Given that in my spare 
time I enjoy photography and videography, I wanted to see if I 
could utilize what I learned through these hobbies and showcase 
the beauty of the Baltic Sea and provide an interesting medium 
for our research. I sincerely hope that you will enjoy it.

Frane Madiraca
